        An unmapped action FAILS OPEN (allow), loudly. It previously fell back
        to a hardcoded ``10``, which was the generative defect behind a
        fleet-wide alert blackout (2026-07-28):

        ``telegram_alert`` and ``s3_alert`` were never added to the budget map
        when those notifiers shipped, so a config setting
        ``max_alerts_per_day: 100`` reached only ``slack_alert``/``email_alert``
        — channels that fleet did not use — while Telegram, the only channel
        anyone actually read, silently took the hardcoded 10/day, counted
        against a store SHARED by every consumer. The budget burned out early
        each day, so terminal pipeline notifications (which happen late) were
        systematically dropped while start-of-run pings got through. Two
        consecutive production trading-pipeline failures paged and were never
        seen; 12 of 13 terminal notifications were suppressed over two days.

        A silent small default is the wrong failure direction for an alerting
        library: an extra alert costs noise, a dropped one costs an outage.

        ``severity`` exempts genuine failure pages from the daily cap
        (``rate_limit_exempt_severities``, default critical+error). Storms of
        the SAME failure are already handled by signature dedup and
        ``dedup_cooldown_minutes``; the daily cap is a blunt backstop that must
        never be the thing that silences a page.
